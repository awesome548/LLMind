TASK:
Explore into the given Aspect in the current Taxonomy, suggest new Options that:
- define the range of possible paths through the design space.
- serve both as enablers of creative thinking (by outlining possibilities) and constraints (by ruling out alternatives when one option is chosen)

ASPECT TO EXPLORE:
ID: {{SELECTED_NODE_ID}}
Topic: {{SELECTED_NODE_TOPIC}}

TAXONOMY:
{{TAXONOMY}}

Respond in the following format
THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```
In <JSON> provide ID of the node that you explored and create new Node ids accordingly, and Options. 
Suppose explored node is "Aspect", each of new Nodes is "Option":
- Aspect: a key dimension or parameter of the design space (e.g., display technology, location, type of interaction).
- Option: possible alternatives for an aspect (e.g., for the aspect “Display,” options might include LED panels or projection).
At the root, there are the "parent_id": (str) and "options" with list for each new node id (str): a new option (str)
the options should be concise and simple.
